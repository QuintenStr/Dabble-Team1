        <h2>The Game Rules</h2>

        Each player's goal is to create one 2 letter word, one 3 letter word, one 4 letter word,
        one 5 letter word and one 6 letter word from 20 selected tiles before the timer runs out.Each player picks 20
        tiles from the bag without looking at them.As you pick your tiles, place them face down in front of you.Once all
        the players have selected their tiles, turn the timer over to begin the first round, which lasts until the timer
        runs out.All players turn their tiles face up and begin to create their 5 words.

        <h3>WHAT TO DO WHEN NO ONE WINS THE ROUND:</h3>
        If no one is able to create 5 words before the timer runs out, players can choose to
        exchange any or all of their tiles. Players should put the tiles they chose to exchange
        into the bag and pick out the same number of tiles as they discarded.Once the new tiles have been selected, the
        timer is turned over and the next round begins. This method of playing continues until there is a winner.

        <h3>WHAT TO DO WHEN ONE PLAYER WINS THE ROUND:</h3>
        If one player created 5 words without exchanging tiles, he/she wins the round and gets
        the total points of the other player's unused tiles (letters not used in a word on their
        rack) as his/her score for this round. The other player(s) get 0 points for this round.


        <h3>WHAT TO DO WHEN MORE THAN ONE PLAYER WINS THE ROUND:</h3>
        If more than one player has created 5 words without exchanging tiles, then each
        winning player gets the total points of the other player's unused tiles. The other
        player(s) get 0 points for this round.

        <h3>WHAT TO DO WHEN ALL PLAYERS WIN THE ROUND:</h3>
        If all the players created 5 words without exchanging tiles within the allotted time, then the player with the
        highest score for any one word on his or her rack is considered the winner of this round and gets the amount of
        points of that one winning word. The other
        players get 0 points for this round. If there's still a tie, and all players have the same
        score for their highest-scoring word, each player receives their points.

        <h3>CHALLENGING A WORD:</h3>
        When the 5 words are presented to finalize a round, any player can challenge a word,
        either as being misspelled, or not a word at all. Refer to your personal dictionary to
        settle challenges. If the challenger is correct and the word is indeed incorrect, the presenter of the word deducts
        the points from his/her score.

        <h3>SPECIALTY TILES:</h3>
        Blank tiles have no point value and can be used as any letter, but NOT as an
        apostrophe.There are 2 apostrophe tiles per game and they have NO point value when used in a word, but count as a
        tile.Each player including the winner of the round gets double points for a word with an apostrophe. When an
        apostrophe tile is NOT used in a word by the end of a round, the winner gets 5 points for it.

        <h3>ADVANCED PLAY - SUBJECT WORDS:</h3>
        At the beginning of each round, choose a “Subject Category” — see below for
        examples. Players should try to spell subject words whenever possible during that
        round.
        — Clothing: hat, scarf, shoe, coat, blouse, jacket, sock, etc.
        — Foods: cereal, milk, bread, toast, egg, bacon, meat, butter, etc.
        — House Objects: carpet, lamp, couch, chair, bed, table, bulb, pot, etc.
        At the end of each round, each player including the winner of the round gets the point value for each subject word
        used on his/her rack in addition to points earned through regular Dabble play.

        <h3>SPECIAL NOTE:</h3>
        All words labeled as a part of speech, including those listed of foreign origin, archaic,
        obsolete, colloquial, and slang are permitted in DABBLE, with the exception of
        abbreviations, prefixes, suffixes standing alone, and proper nouns. When playing in
        English, remove the 6 tiles labeled rr, rr, ll, ll, ñ, ñ.

        142 tiles (plus 6 Spanish tiles); 4 five-tier stadium style racks; Sand timer; Tile bag;
